In this repository, I uploaded the research I did in Bayesian methods while I was in grad school, including computational Bayesian statistcs, and Bayesian Networks. 
Some of the applications I started with are clinical trials, and Bayesian networks in forensic sience and the law.
I will be updating this repo, and add more repos about probabilistic programming as I do more projects in the field.  
If you are interested in any of the aforementioned, feel free to contact me, It's always great to have someone to talk to about these fun stuff.
